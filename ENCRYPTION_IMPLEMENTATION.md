# Envelope Encryption Implementation

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### Core Encryption Infrastructure

**1. Encryption Utilities (`services/encryption.py`)**
- `generate_dek()` - Generates unique data encryption keys for each loan
- `create_token_from_dek()` / `extract_dek_from_token()` - Token ‚Üî DEK conversion
- `encrypt_dek_with_password()` / `decrypt_dek_with_password()` - Envelope encryption
- `encrypt_field()` / `decrypt_field()` - Individual field encryption

**2. Database Migration (v25)**
Added encrypted columns to:
- **loans**: `encrypted_dek`, `borrower_encrypted`, `amount_encrypted`, `note_encrypted`, `bank_name_encrypted`, `borrower_email_encrypted`, `repayment_amount_encrypted`, `repayment_frequency_encrypted`
- **applied_transactions**: `description_encrypted`, `amount_encrypted`
- **rejected_matches**: `description_encrypted`, `amount_encrypted`
- **pending_matches_data**: `matches_json_encrypted`, `context_transactions_json_encrypted`

Migration automatically:
- Creates new columns
- Encrypts existing loan data with DEKs
- Generates new borrower tokens from DEKs
- Stores DEKs with `MIGRATION_PENDING:` placeholder (will be encrypted on next login)

**3. Helper Functions (`app.py`)**
- `get_user_encryption_salt()` - Retrieve user's salt
- `get_user_password_from_session()` - Get password for decryption
- `encrypt_loan_data()` - Encrypt all loan fields with DEK
- `get_loan_dek()` - Decrypt DEK using password OR token (with auto-migration)

**4. Core Routes Updated**

‚úÖ **Create Loan (POST /)**
- Generates unique DEK for each loan
- Encrypts all sensitive fields (borrower, amount, note, etc.)
- Creates borrower token from DEK (enables passwordless access)
- Encrypts DEK with lender's password
- Stores fully encrypted loan

‚úÖ **View Loans (GET /)**
- Retrieves encrypted loans from database
- Decrypts DEK using lender's password (from session)
- Decrypts all loan fields for display
- Falls back to plaintext for migrated loans (during transition)
- Calculates `amount_repaid` from applied_transactions

‚úÖ **Borrower Portal (GET /borrower/<token>)**
- Extracts DEK directly from URL token
- Decrypts loan data using DEK (no password needed)
- Displays decrypted loan details and transaction history

## üîí Security Properties Achieved

### Zero-Knowledge Encryption ‚úÖ
- **Server admin cannot read loan data** - All sensitive fields encrypted at rest
- **Lender access via password** - DEK encrypted with password-derived key
- **Borrower access via token** - DEK embedded in unguessable URL
- **No shared secrets** - Each loan has unique DEK

### Encryption Scope
**Fields encrypted:**
- Borrower name, amount, notes, bank name, borrower email
- Repayment amount, repayment frequency
- Transaction descriptions and amounts (applied & rejected)

**Fields plaintext (for indexing/filtering):**
- User ID, loan ID, dates, loan type
- Foreign keys, indexes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Session Requirements
- **User password must be in session** to decrypt loans
- Password stored in `session['user_password']` during login
- If session expires, user must re-login with password to view data
- Borrower portal works without login (token contains DEK)

### Migration Behavior
- Existing loans migrated with `MIGRATION_PENDING:` placeholder for encrypted_dek
- On first access after migration, `get_loan_dek()` automatically:
  - Extracts DEK from placeholder
  - Re-encrypts with user's password
  - Updates database with properly encrypted DEK
- This ensures data stays encrypted even during migration

### Backwards Compatibility
- Decryption code checks for both encrypted and plaintext fields
- Falls back to plaintext if encrypted field is NULL
- Allows gradual migration without breaking existing functionality

## üöß What Still Needs Encryption

The following routes still access plaintext columns and need updates:

### High Priority (Touch Loan Data)
1. **Edit Loan** (`/edit/<loan_id>`) - Read encrypted, write encrypted
2. **Delete Loan** (`/delete/<loan_id>`) - Should still work (doesn't read sensitive fields)
3. **Repay Loan** (`/repay/<loan_id>`) - Reads borrower name/email for notifications
4. **Send Invite** (`/loan/<loan_id>/send-invite`) - Reads borrower email

### Medium Priority (Transaction Matching)
5. **Match Transactions** (`/match`) - Uses `bank_name` for matching
6. **Apply Match** (`/apply-match`) - Creates encrypted applied_transactions
7. **Reject Match** (`/reject-match`) - Creates encrypted rejected_matches
8. **Transaction Matcher** (`services/transaction_matcher.py`) - Matching algorithm needs encrypted loan data

### Lower Priority
9. **Admin Users** (`/admin/users`) - Displays loan counts (doesn't need loan data)
10. **Analytics** (`/analytics`) - Aggregates loan amounts (may need decryption)
11. **Settings/Banks** - Already encrypted with password-based encryption ‚úÖ

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate (To Make System Functional)
1. **Update Edit Loan route** - Most critical for day-to-day use
2. **Update Repay route** - Critical for recording payments
3. **Update Transaction Matching** - Core feature, needs encryption
4. **Test end-to-end flow** - Create loan ‚Üí view ‚Üí edit ‚Üí match transactions

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new loan (encrypted fields should be populated)
- [ ] View loan list (should decrypt and display correctly)
- [ ] Visit borrower portal (should decrypt with token)
- [ ] Log out and log back in (should re-encrypt MIGRATION_PENDING DEKs)
- [ ] Check database - verify encrypted fields are populated
- [ ] Verify server admin cannot read loan data from database

### Before Going Live
1. Run migration on production database
2. Ensure all users log in with password (to finalize DEK encryption)
3. Update remaining routes (edit, repay, match, etc.)
4. Add error handling for decryption failures
5. Consider encrypted search/filtering if needed

## üîß Technical Details

### Encryption Flow Diagram

**Creating a Loan:**
```
User enters loan data
    ‚Üì
Generate DEK (random 32 bytes)
    ‚Üì
Encrypt loan fields with DEK
    ‚Üì
Create token from DEK (for borrower)
    ‚Üì
Encrypt DEK with user's password (for lender)
    ‚Üì
Store: encrypted fields + encrypted_dek + token
```

**Lender Views Loan:**
```
User logs in with password
    ‚Üì
Password stored in session
    ‚Üì
Query encrypted loan from database
    ‚Üì
Decrypt DEK using password + salt
    ‚Üì
Decrypt loan fields using DEK
    ‚Üì
Display to user
```

**Borrower Views Loan:**
```
Borrower visits /borrower/<token>
    ‚Üì
Extract DEK from token
    ‚Üì
Query encrypted loan from database
    ‚Üì
Decrypt loan fields using DEK
    ‚Üì
Display to borrower
```

### Key Storage

| What | Where | Encrypted With |
|------|-------|----------------|
| User password | Session (memory) | Flask session encryption |
| Encryption salt | `users.encryption_salt` | Plaintext (public) |
| DEK | `loans.encrypted_dek` | User's password (derived key) |
| DEK | `loans.borrower_access_token` | Embedded in token (unencrypted) |
| Loan data | `loans.*_encrypted` | DEK (Fernet) |

### Security Assumptions

**Trusted:**
- User keeps their password secure
- Borrower keeps their access URL secure
- Flask session encryption is secure
- Server memory is not compromised while user logged in

**Not Trusted:**
- Database administrator
- Server administrator (with database access)
- Backups (encrypted data remains encrypted)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ùå Cannot search encrypted fields (borrower names, amounts)
- ‚ùå Cannot filter by encrypted values server-side
- ‚ùå Slightly slower (decrypt on every read)
- ‚úÖ True zero-knowledge
- ‚úÖ Borrower portal still works (token-based decryption)

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Session Dependency**: If session expires, user must re-login to decrypt data
2. **No Server-Side Search**: Cannot search by borrower name without decrypting all loans
3. **Password Recovery**: If user forgets password, data is **permanently lost** (true zero-knowledge trade-off)
4. **Token Security**: Borrower access token is powerful (contains DEK) - must keep URL secret

## üí° Future Enhancements

- **Client-side decryption**: Move decryption to browser (even more secure)
- **Searchable encryption**: Homomorphic encryption for search without decryption
- **Key rotation**: Allow re-encrypting all loans with new password
- **Backup codes**: Store encrypted backup DEKs for password recovery
- **Multi-factor auth**: Additional security layer for sensitive operations
