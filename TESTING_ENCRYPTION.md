# Testing Encryption Implementation

## Quick Start Test

### 1. Run the Migration

```bash
python app.py
```

This will automatically run migration v25 and encrypt existing data.

You should see output like:
```
üìä Current database version: 24
  Starting envelope encryption migration...
    Added encrypted_dek column to loans table.
    Added borrower_encrypted column to loans table.
    ...
    Found X loans to encrypt...
    Encrypted X loans.
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: DEKs stored with temporary placeholder - will be encrypted with user password on next login
  ‚úÖ Envelope encryption migration complete!
‚úÖ Migration v25 applied.
```

### 2. Verify Database Schema

```bash
sqlite3 lendifyme.db "PRAGMA table_info(loans);"
```

You should see new columns:
- `encrypted_dek`
- `borrower_encrypted`
- `amount_encrypted`
- `note_encrypted`
- `bank_name_encrypted`
- `borrower_email_encrypted`
- `repayment_amount_encrypted`
- `repayment_frequency_encrypted`

### 3. Check Encrypted Data

```bash
sqlite3 lendifyme.db "SELECT id, borrower_encrypted, amount_encrypted, encrypted_dek FROM loans LIMIT 1;"
```

You should see:
- `borrower_encrypted`: `gAAAAABm...` (encrypted gibberish)
- `amount_encrypted`: `gAAAAABm...` (encrypted gibberish)
- `encrypted_dek`: `MIGRATION_PENDING:xxxxxxxxxxx` (temporary placeholder)

### 4. Test the Application

**A. Create a New Loan**
1. Log in with your password
2. Create a test loan:
   - Borrower: "Test Person"
   - Amount: 100.00
   - Note: "Secret note"

**B. Verify Encryption in Database**
```bash
sqlite3 lendifyme.db "SELECT borrower, borrower_encrypted, encrypted_dek FROM loans WHERE borrower_encrypted IS NOT NULL ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;"
```

Expected output:
- `borrower`: Empty or NULL (plaintext column not used)
- `borrower_encrypted`: `gAAAAABm...` (Fernet-encrypted data)
- `encrypted_dek`: `gAAAAABm...` (properly encrypted, no MIGRATION_PENDING)

**C. Verify You Can See Decrypted Data**
1. Go to the home page
2. You should see "Test Person" and "$100.00" displayed
3. This proves decryption works!

**D. Test Borrower Portal**
1. Copy the borrower portal link from your loan
2. Open in incognito/private window (to simulate borrower)
3. You should see loan details (proves token-based decryption works)

### 5. Verify Server Admin Cannot Read Data

**Simulate a database administrator:**

```bash
# Try to read loan data directly from database
sqlite3 lendifyme.db "SELECT borrower, borrower_encrypted FROM loans;"
```

You should see:
- `borrower`: Empty/NULL (old plaintext column)
- `borrower_encrypted`: `gAAAAABm...` (gibberish - cannot be read!)

**This proves zero-knowledge encryption is working!** üéâ

## Detailed Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Migration of Existing Data

**Before migration:**
```sql
SELECT id, borrower, amount, borrower_encrypted FROM loans;
-- borrower: "Alice"
-- amount: 500.0
-- borrower_encrypted: NULL
```

**After migration:**
```sql
SELECT id, borrower, borrower_encrypted, encrypted_dek FROM loans;
-- borrower: NULL or "Alice" (kept temporarily for backwards compatibility)
-- borrower_encrypted: "gAAAAABm..." (encrypted)
-- encrypted_dek: "MIGRATION_PENDING:..." (temporary, will be finalized on login)
```

**After first login:**
```sql
SELECT id, encrypted_dek FROM loans;
-- encrypted_dek: "gAAAAABm..." (properly encrypted with user's password)
```

### Test 2: Create New Loan (Full Encryption)

**Expected database state:**
```sql
SELECT
    borrower,  -- Should be NULL
    borrower_encrypted,  -- Should be encrypted
    amount,  -- Should be NULL
    amount_encrypted,  -- Should be encrypted
    encrypted_dek,  -- Should be encrypted (no MIGRATION_PENDING)
    borrower_access_token  -- Should be the DEK in base64
FROM loans
WHERE id = <new_loan_id>;
```

All encrypted fields should start with `gAAAAAB` (Fernet signature).

### Test 3: Borrower Portal Access

**Test token extraction:**
```python
from services.encryption import extract_dek_from_token, decrypt_field

# Get token from database
token = "..." # from borrower_access_token column

# Extract DEK
dek = extract_dek_from_token(token)

# Should be 44 bytes (32-byte key, base64 encoded)
print(len(dek))  # 44
```

**Verify token can decrypt data:**
```python
# Get encrypted borrower name from database
borrower_encrypted = "gAAAAABm..."

# Decrypt using DEK from token
borrower_name = decrypt_field(borrower_encrypted, dek)
print(borrower_name)  # "Alice" (decrypted!)
```

### Test 4: Password-Based Decryption (Lender)

**Test DEK decryption:**
```python
from services.encryption import decrypt_dek_with_password

# Get from database
encrypted_dek = "gAAAAABm..."
user_password = "mypassword"  # from session
encryption_salt = "rH8F2vP..."  # from users.encryption_salt

# Decrypt DEK
dek = decrypt_dek_with_password(encrypted_dek, user_password, encryption_salt)
print(len(dek))  # 44 bytes
```

### Test 5: Verify Zero-Knowledge

**Things a database admin CANNOT do:**
1. ‚ùå Read borrower names without password
2. ‚ùå Read loan amounts without password
3. ‚ùå Read notes without password
4. ‚ùå Decrypt DEK without user's password
5. ‚ùå Search for loans by borrower name

**Things a database admin CAN see:**
1. ‚úÖ User IDs (who owns which loan)
2. ‚úÖ Dates (when loans were created/due)
3. ‚úÖ Loan IDs, transaction IDs
4. ‚úÖ Encrypted blobs (but cannot decrypt them)
5. ‚úÖ Borrower access tokens (but if they don't know which loan it belongs to, can't use it)

**Test this:**
```sql
-- Admin tries to find all loans for user "Alice"
SELECT * FROM loans WHERE borrower LIKE '%Alice%';
-- Returns 0 rows! (borrower is encrypted)

-- Admin tries to find loans over $1000
SELECT * FROM loans WHERE amount > 1000;
-- Returns 0 rows! (amount is encrypted)

-- Admin can only see encrypted data
SELECT borrower_encrypted, amount_encrypted FROM loans;
-- gAAAAABmXY..., gAAAAABmXZ...
-- Meaningless without the decryption keys!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Please log in with your password to view your loans"

**Cause:** User password not in session (session expired or magic link login)

**Fix:**
1. Log out
2. Log in using password (not magic link)
3. Password will be stored in session for decryption

### Issue: "Failed to decrypt DEK for loan X"

**Causes:**
1. Wrong password in session
2. Corrupted encrypted_dek in database
3. User changed password (DEK encrypted with old password)

**Debug:**
```python
# Check if encrypted_dek exists
SELECT id, encrypted_dek FROM loans WHERE id = X;

# Check if it's still using migration placeholder
SELECT encrypted_dek FROM loans WHERE encrypted_dek LIKE 'MIGRATION_PENDING:%';
```

### Issue: Borrower portal shows "Unable to decrypt loan data"

**Causes:**
1. Invalid token format
2. Token doesn't match a valid loan
3. Corrupted borrower_access_token

**Debug:**
```sql
-- Check token in database
SELECT id, borrower_access_token FROM loans WHERE id = X;

-- Token should be exactly 44 characters (base64-encoded 32 bytes)
SELECT LENGTH(borrower_access_token) FROM loans WHERE id = X;
-- Should return: 44
```

### Issue: All encrypted fields are NULL

**Cause:** Migration didn't run or failed

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check database version
sqlite3 lendifyme.db "PRAGMA user_version;"
# Should be 25 or higher

# If it's less than 25, migration didn't run
# Check app.py startup logs for migration errors
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Migration v25 completed successfully
- [ ] New encrypted columns exist in loans table
- [ ] Existing loans have encrypted data populated
- [ ] New loans created with encrypted data
- [ ] Can view loan list (decryption works)
- [ ] Can access borrower portal (token decryption works)
- [ ] Database admin cannot read loan data in plaintext
- [ ] MIGRATION_PENDING placeholders replaced after login
- [ ] No plaintext sensitive data in database

## Security Audit Queries

**Check for any plaintext loan data:**
```sql
-- These should all return 0 or NULL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE borrower IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE amount IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE note IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE bank_name IS NOT NULL;
```

**Check encryption coverage:**
```sql
-- All loans should have encrypted fields
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE borrower_encrypted IS NULL;
-- Should be 0

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE amount_encrypted IS NULL;
-- Should be 0
```

**Check DEK encryption status:**
```sql
-- Check for migration placeholders (should be 0 after users login)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE encrypted_dek LIKE 'MIGRATION_PENDING:%';

-- All loans should have encrypted DEKs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE encrypted_dek IS NULL;
-- Should be 0
```

**Verify no sensitive data in logs:**
```bash
# Check application logs for accidental plaintext logging
grep -i "alice\|bob\|charlie" logs/lendifyme.log
# Should not find borrower names in logs
```

## Performance Testing

**Test decryption performance:**
```python
import time
from app import app, get_db_path, get_loan_dek
import sqlite3

with app.app_context():
    # Simulate loading 100 loans
    start = time.time()

    conn = sqlite3.connect(get_db_path())
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("SELECT id FROM loans LIMIT 100")
    loan_ids = [row[0] for row in c.fetchall()]

    for loan_id in loan_ids:
        dek = get_loan_dek(loan_id, user_password="test")
        # Decrypt loan fields here...

    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"Decrypted 100 loans in {elapsed:.2f}s")
    # Should be under 1 second for 100 loans
    conn.close()
```
