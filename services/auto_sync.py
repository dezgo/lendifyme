"""
Auto-sync service for automatically fetching and matching bank transactions.

When users log in, this service:
1. Fetches new transactions from all connected banks
2. Runs matching algorithm against unpaid/partially-paid loans
3. Auto-applies high-confidence matches (â‰¥80%)
4. Flags medium-confidence matches (50-79%) for review
